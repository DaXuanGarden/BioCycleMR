## Introduction

`BioCycleMR` is an R package crafted with the objective of enhancing Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis in the field of biomedical research. Designed to integrate diverse exposure data types, the tool is an amalgamation of traditional medicinal insights and the dynamism of modern genomics.

## Installation and Usage

### Installing the Package

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DaXuanGarden/BioCycleMR")
```

### Load and Commence

``` r
library(BioCycleMR)
results <- runBioCycleMR(your_exposure_data, your_outcome_data)
print(results)
```

### Detailed Function Descriptions

#### Immune cells

1.  **Retrieve Data for 731 Immune Cells**

    Fetch data for 731 immune cells. Choose between using preprocessed data or custom parameters (We have already prepared the results using the built-in default parameters `p1 = 1e-05,`). 
    ``` r
    immc_data_preprocessed <- get_immc(use_preprocessed = TRUE)
    immc_data_custom <- get_immc(use_preprocessed = FALSE, 
								 p1 = 1e-05, 
								 p2 = 5e-08, 
								 r2 = 0.001, 
								 kb = 10000, 
								 mc_cores = 10)
    ```

2.  **Preprocess FinnGen R9 Data**

    We recommend that you preprocess FinnGen R9 Data into a format with the suffix `.rda` (You will need to place the files downloaded from the [FinnGen R9 Data](https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results) in the specified directory).

    ``` r
    get_finn(finn_dir = "finn", save_dir = "finn_r", cores = 30)
    ```

3.  **Retrieve GWAS Datasets Using Keyword or ID**

    Identify potential genetic instruments for MR analysis using keywords or IDs.

    ``` r
    get_gwas_id("Myocardial infarction")
    get_gwas_id("finn-b-N14_ENDOMETRIOSIS")
    ```

4.  **Convert Local VCF File for Two-Sample MR Analysis**

    Convert VCF files for MR studies.

    ``` r
    get_local("ieu-a-2.vcf.gz", "exposure")
    ```

5.  **Calculate F-values and MAF**

    Estimate F-statistics and minor allele frequency for MR studies.

    ``` r
    data("dx_immu_cell_raw_df")
    result_list <- get_f_maf(dat_object = immu_cell_raw,F_value = 10,maf_threshold = 0.01,)
    immu_cell_f = result_list[[1]],
    immu_cell_f_select = result_list[[2]],
    SNP_stats_f = result_list[[3]]
    ```

6.  **Complex Operations with `get_tsmr`**

    The code below will create folders and output the results of MR, heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and PRESSO level pleiotropy tests

    ``` r
    get_tsmr(immu_cell_f_select, finn_r_dir="finn_r", cores = 64)
    ```

7.  **Compute Effect Size Estimates from `.rda` Files**

    Derive effect size metrics from .rda files.

    ``` r
    get_effect("~/path_to_directory", immune_ref_data)
    ```

## Future Developments

`BioCycleMR` is designed with adaptability and scalability in mind. While it stands as a reflection of the current knowledge and skills of its creators, they envisage it to evolve, incorporating advancements in biomedical research and feedback from the scientific community.

## Community Engagement and Feedback

Open communication channels and collaborations are the lifeblood of `BioCycleMR`. The creators earnestly invite the community to pitch in, share insights, suggest enhancements, or even critique -- every interaction is a step towards refinement.
